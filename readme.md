# Midjourny Colab Notebook

Midjourny Colab Notebook is a project that allows users to access the Midjourny WebGui over Google Colab's hardware. This project is particularly useful for those who want to run Midjourny on a powerful machine, but don't have access to one.

## What is Colab?

Google Colaboratory, or Colab for short, is a free cloud-based service provided by Google that allows users to run Python code using Jupyter notebooks. Colab provides access to powerful hardware, including GPUs and TPUs, which can be used to train machine learning models and run other computationally intensive tasks.

## How long can you run a program on Colab?

Colab provides users with a virtual machine that can be used for up to 12 hours at a time. After 12 hours, the virtual machine will be automatically terminated, and any unsaved data will be lost. However, users can save their work to Google Drive or GitHub to avoid losing their progress.

## How to use Midjourny Colab Notebook

To use Midjourny Colab Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Open the Colab notebook by clicking on the "Open in Colab" button.
2. Click on "Runtime" in the top menu, then select "Run all".
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to access the Midjourny WebGui.

Note that you will need to have a Google account to use Colab. If you don't have one, you can create one for free at https://accounts.google.com/signup.
